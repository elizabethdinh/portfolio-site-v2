        <h1>Credit Karma Redesign</h1></div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Credit Karma is a tool launched in 2007 that allows over 100 million users to view their credit scores and reports in order to help them manage their money more efficiently. Credit Karma users also have access to features including but not limited to: credit score simulation, auto/mortgage loan comparisons, recommended credit cards, and tax filing.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
            Credit Karma users are from the United States, United Kingdom, or Canada. Credit Karmas requires users to be at least 18 years of age, but a majority of the users are millennials (ages 24-39).
        </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
            It has a fairly steep learning curve for beginners due to its complicated design. The objective of the application is to make managing money and various loans easier for people, yet it’s confusing for people who do not have much financial knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>
            I ran two experienced user interviews and five naive user evaluations. I noticed that:

            <ul>
                <li>When asked to find the credit score simulator, most people struggled</li>
                <li>People felt annoyed with the large number of ads on the website</li>
                <li>Users were confused by unintuitive links on the menu (like Money Center)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>I decluttered the menu and gave some features more intuitive names (e.g. renamed Money Center to Cash Ideas, since its purpose was to suggest users on how to earn cash quickly short-term)</li>
                <li>Putting the Credit Card Simulator feature on the front page was important, since many users want this feature yet it’s so hard to find</li>  
                <li>I added an optional tutorial for first-time users, since many people are not properly educated on managing money and credit cards/loans</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
