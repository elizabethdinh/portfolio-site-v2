                            The Undergraduate Research Opportunities website is offered to UCSC undergraduate students as a resource for them to explore research labs that are open for them to join and get information--such as scholarships, preparing to join a lab, and emailing professors.

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
            Users of the UCSC undergraduate research website are typically UCSC undergraduate students and professors. Specifically, this website attracts undergraduate students who are interested in graduate school and need labs to apply to graduate programs. It also lures in professors seeking students to help with their labs.
        </p>
        <h2>Needfinding</h2>
        <p>
            Based off eight interviews of UCSC students who have worked as undergraduate research assistants, students wanted the following in the website:
            <ul>
                <li>Easy access to information on current available lab positions</li>
                <li>Efficient communication with graduate students and professors</li>
                <li>Information on what it’s like to be in a research lab</li>
                <li>Guidance on applying to labs and how will labs help with future plans</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Heuristics Analysis</h2>
        <p>After running heuristic evaluations on the currently deployed website, we found major flaws:
            <ul>
                <li>The website is too cluttered in both the navigation menu and page content</li>
                <li>The search bar doesn’t give users feedback</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
            Based on our findings from interviews and heuristic evaluations, Ivy and I created two different wireframes to use for user testing. Ivy sketched out prototype A, whereas I worked on prototype B.

        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>
            After running eight user evaluations using A/B testing and WoZ testing, we found that:
            <ul>
                <li>Occasionally, users struggled with finding contact info for labs</li>
                <li>Users did not have an easy way out if they got stuck or were confused</li>
                <li>Users tend to use the search bar to find information when they don’t know which link to click on</li>
                <li>Interviewees seemed to have an easier time using prototype B</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            We simplified the menu structure and made link names more intuitive to prevent users from being confused and overwhelmed.

        <p>
            We also gave users an FAQ page and feedback as they type in letters into the search bar.
